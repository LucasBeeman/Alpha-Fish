            <h1> About our Company</h1>
            <p>Schools of fish donâ€™t have leaders. This makes schools uncoordinated,
                and easy targets for whales and sharks. Alpha Fish was made to 
                counter this problem. We train fish to become leaders of their
                school and have them be much harder to defeat.<br><br>

               <p> Lucas Beeman is the sole proprietor of Alpha Fish. Lucas Beeman has
                a degree in Marine Biology, has experimented his services with many
                fish types, and has found the best trainers in the sea. He let 
                volunteers enter his program for free and has been shown that 8/10
                fish have become leaders of their schools.

            <h1>What we do</h1>
            <p>Alpha Fish sells trainers for specific weaknesses that the fish has. 
                For example, if the fish is physically weak, you can hire a trainer
                that focuses on physical training. There are many types of 
                trainers and therapists that will help you become a true alpha
                of the school.

            <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
            <p>Alpha Fish's goal is to train fish into being the best of their 
                school. We train our clients physically, mentally, 
                and emotionally. This will make the fish the best leaders, the 
                most prepared for danger, and the most mentally stable of the 
                school. Alpha fish is like no other in the fish training 
                business, because we are the fist to train fish for practical 
                purposes, and not for entertainment.
